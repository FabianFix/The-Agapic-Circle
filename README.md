## All of philosophy in one place

The Agapic Circle is a peer-reviewed open-source repository detailing the thoughts, works and lives of some of the world's greatest thinkers. We believe that no great ideas come in isolation, but instead that they are shaped by their surroundings, the conversations had by the thinkers and the events surrounding them. 

## Our Mission

We aim to collect these conversations, events and great works in one place, so that you, the reader can use them as tools in your own philosophical toolbox. Our goal is to help authors, philosophers and artists gain inspiration and understanding for the ideas that has come before them, something we believe is very helpful when creating art or writing literature. 

## Get involved!

If you have any ideas for articles to write or thinkers to highlight, don't hesitate to contribute! All you have to do is to create the article as a Markdown-file and add it to the relevant folder in our github-repository (through a pull request), we will then review the writing and start a correspondence around how it can be improved. When both we and you are happy with the state of the article, it will be published to the website!
